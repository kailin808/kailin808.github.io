My mom is a local business owner, with most of our familyâ€™s income coming from the business. In her first couple of years, she faced problems that most small businesses face but luckily, she had the chance to work with an accountant who helped her be in the best financial position for her to prosper. As a result, I chose to pursue a major in business and, more specifically, accounting. Seeing my mom struggle as a local business owner and overcoming the challenges inspired me to aid others like her. I want to assist business owners in being financially successful.

When I applied to the University of Hawaii, Manoa, I knew that I wanted to pursue a major and career in Accounting. I enjoy handling money and numbers while also recognizing that Accounting provides a clear career path of how to progress and make money. Therefore, I decided to join the Accounting Club to be alongside like-minded individuals and develop professionally and personally. The Accounting Club allowed me to meet with professionals from various firms, attend informational sessions, and network with alumni. Throughout my time in the club, many people have mentioned how MIS is starting to play a more prominent role in the Accounting industry and is most likely the future of the career path. 

With this fact in mind, I decided to look more into the MIS major and its relation to the Accounting career. Now I have the opportunity to take ITM 352 and begin my journey into this MIS major. The skills and knowledge I learn from completing this class will improve my abilities as a prospective employee in the workplace.
